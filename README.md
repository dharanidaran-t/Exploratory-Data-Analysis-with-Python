## About Dataset
### Content:
In this Dataset, we have Historical Population data for every Country/Territory in the world by different parameters like Area Size of the Country/Territory,
Name of the Continent, Name of the Capital, Density, Population Growth Rate, Ranking based on Population, World Population Percentage, etc.


## Inferences and Conclusions

We've drawn some inferences from our above analysis. Here's a summary of them:

- Asia is the largest continent with nearly 23.6% of landmass while Oceania is the smallest with 6.3% landmass. Africa has the second highest landmass.

- Among the list of countries, China has the highest population while Vatican City has the least. India is the 2nd highest populous country. Asia consists of the maximum countries that lies top in the list of populous countries, followed by Africa.

- Bangladesh has exceptionally high population density due to its less landmass area. On the contrary, Russia has low population density due to its large landmass.

- China, being the most populous country doesn't have incredibly high population density, but the same can not be said about India, who is almost twice as dense in population compared to China.

- Vatican City is the country with the least landmass and also the least population.

- In South American countries, there has been significant rise in population over last 5 decades, except for Venezuela whose population decreased in the last decade.

- Almost every Asian country has risen twice in population count over the last 5 decades. Though, it can be noticed that Countries like Hong Kong, Armenia and Georgia haven't had a population spike like the other Asian countries.

- Countries like Cambodia, Jordan, Kuwait, UAE and many more to have a drastic increase in population. There must have been exponential growth in economy, geographical & political status in these countries.

- Georgia shows a unique degrading trend in population count over the last 5 decades. Population in Georgia dropped constantly since 1990.

- UAE has an incredible rise in population in the first decade of this century. There must have been some social, industrial or political development that might have supported this huge population change.
